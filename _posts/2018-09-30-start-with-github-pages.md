Wow, Github Pages must have done it exactly right - I only learned about it yesterday, and today I already have a basic site set up.

The main part is getting to learn a bit about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. Jekyll happends to be written in Ruby so I got to use stuff like [Gem](https://rubygems.org) for the first time too. The good things about Jekyll are..

- Ready features to support creating blog sites, with lots of beautiful layouts available to use (see [jekyllthemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io) )
- Official support from Github
- Simple, makrdown friendly
